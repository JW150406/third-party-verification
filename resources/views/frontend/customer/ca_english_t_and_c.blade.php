		<p class="Normal tm18 tm28"><span class="tm29">Public Utilities Code Section 986 requires that each registered Core Transport Agent (CTA) offering natural gas (gas) service to residential and small commercial customers provide
		the potential customer with this written notice prior to the commencement of service. This written notice describes the price, terms and conditions of service that will apply to you, if you decide to purchase gas from us.
		Bolt Energy is a registered CTA with the California Public Utilities Commission. Our CTA registration number is CTA0039. Our address is 75 Lake Road Suite 215 Congers, N.Y. 10920. Our toll-free telephone number is (800) 213-2870.
		</span></p>
		<h1 class="tm30"><strong><span class="tm29">&#160;</span></strong></h1>
		<h1 class="tm30"><strong><span class="tm27">Summary</span></strong></h1>
		<p class="Normal tm18 tm31"><span class="tm29">This notice contains important information regarding the price, terms, and conditions of service with our company. This summary describes some of the more important points covered
		in this notice. You should, however, read the entire notice so that you understand all of the price, terms, and conditions which apply to you. Your total price of gas is estimated to be $1.49 per day. This total price of gas
		includes the estimated price of gas, the estimated price to transport the gas to your home or business, and all other estimated charges. In addition to your payments to us, you are also obligated to pay your existing gas utility
		certain recurring charges for gas service, and charges regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission. You may also have to pay your gas utility for certain non-recurring charges regulated by the California Public
		Utilities Commission. You should refer to your gas utility bill or contact your gas utility to determine the amount for each of those charges. If you choose our company to be your CTA, you agree to let us be your gas provider
		for a period of 24 months from the enrollment effective date, and then on a month-to-month basis, unless you choose another gas service provider or sign a new service agreement with us. Should you decide to terminate this
		arrangement earlier, you will be responsible of paying a cancellation fee of $199.  You may rescind this agreement by calling our toll free number within 3 business days of the sales agreement, or by sending 30 days written
		notice prior to the expiration of the term. </span></p>
		<h1 class="tm30"><strong><span class="tm29">&#160;</span></strong></h1>
		<h1 class="tm30"><strong><span class="tm27"><b>Your Right To Choose</b></span></strong></h1>
		<p class="Normal tm18 tm32"><span class="tm29">You have the right to choose who you want to purchase your gas from. If you select a CTA to supply you with gas, your existing gas utility will still be responsible for ensuring
		that the gas is transported to your residence or business. If you choose our company to be your CTA, we do not offer a low income assistance program that provides a discount on your gas bill. You may be eligible for low income
		assistance for the gas transport service provided by your existing gas utility. You should contact the gas utility to see if you are eligible for such assistance, and to apply with the gas utility if you are eligible for such
		assistance .In selecting a CTA, you should be aware that the CTA will require you to enter into a contract for a fixed period of time, rather than on a month to month basis. If you enter into a contract for a fixed period
		of time, and you decide to switch your gas provider before the contract term is up, you may be obligated to pay certain fees or penalties for early termination of the contracts. If you choose Bolt Energy to be your CTA, then
		you agree to let us be your natural gas provider for the number of months specified in your contract. Should any CTA refuse to provide you with gas service, you have the right to request, within thirty days from the date service
		was denied, that the CTA send you a written explanation of why the CTA denied you service.</span></p>

		<h1 style="font-weight: 400px !important;" class="tm34"><strong><span class="tm27">Verification That You Want A New Provider of Gas</span></strong></h1>
		<p class="Normal tm18 tm32"><span class="tm29">If you decide to purchase your gas from someone other than your current provider of gas, the law requires the new CTA or the gas utility to verify that you agree to the change
		in your provider. This verification can take place in several ways. If you are a residential customer and you are contacted by a CTA, and you agree to switch to the CTA as your new gas provider, the CTA is required to connect
		you to a &#8220;third-party verification company,&#8221; or to have the third-party verification company call you, to confirm that you agree to switch to the new CTA. The third-party verification company may ask you for certain
		identifying information such as your name, your address, your current gas provider and account number, and whether you agree to the switch to the new CTA that you have selected. You should be careful not to disclose any more
		information than necessary to confirm the switch. The third-party verification company can use the information that you provide only to confirm that you agree to the switch in provider. An unauthorized release of the information
		you supplied to the third- party verification company is grounds for a civil lawsuit. You may also request the third-party verification company for a copy of the record that confirms you have agreed to switch to the new provider
		of your choice. If you are a residential customer and you directly call the CTA that you want to switch to, your new gas provider is not required to use the third-party verification process described above. Instead, your contact
		with the new provider is sufficient to confirm that you agree to switch to the CTA you called. If you are a small commercial customer, the CTA must confirm your agreement to switch to the new provider in one of four ways.
		First, the new CTA can use the third-party verification process described above. The second method is for the new CTA to mail you an information package regarding your agreement to switch, and you return the written confirmation
		to switch. The third method is that the new CTA may have you sign a document which explains to you the effect of the change to a new CTA. And the fourth method is for the new CTA to obtain your consent through electronic means,
		such as e-mail or a facsimile authorization consenting to the switch to the new CTA.</span></p>

		<p class="Normal tm18 tm48"><span class="tm29">If an advance deposit is required, Public Utilities Code Section 985(g) provides that the deposit amount cannot be more than your estimated bill for a three-month period. Although
		you, the customer, will be purchasing gas from us, we will arrange to have the gas utility send you a single bill for the gas utility&#8217;s charges and for our charges. Should you own any past due amounts on your bill, the
		gas utility is responsible for collecting any past due amount from you. If you fail to pay any past due amount owed to the gas utility, the gas utility may then disconnect your service. If you fail to pay any past due amount
		owed to us, we may transfer your gas service back to the gas utility, who may then disconnect your gas service if you fail to pay the gas utility&#8217;s charge. If your gas service is disconnected, you may be obligated to

		regarding the manner in which the gas is distributed to your residence, an informal complaint may be submitted to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for an attempt at resolving the matter. If the matter is not
		resolved, you may file a formal complaint with the CPUC if you meet the conditions set forth in Article 4 of the CPUC&#8217;s Rules of Practice and Procedure. If you have a billing-related or service-related dispute with us,
		the CTA, you may complain to the CPUC. The CPUC shall first attempt to informally resolve your complaint through the informal complaint process. If the matter cannot be resolved satisfactorily, you may file a formal complaint
		against us with the CPUC or file a complaint against us in civil court. You must pay your bill in full, except for the disputed amount, during the pendency of the dispute, and such payment shall be refunded if warranted by
