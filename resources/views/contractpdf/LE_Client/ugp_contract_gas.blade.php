            After your successful enrollment with UGP and confirmation by the utility,
            UGP will supply your natural gas until either you or UGP cancels your
            service. Your service with UGP begins on the date provided to you by the
            utility. UGP is not responsible for utility delays in processing your
            enrollment or cancellation request. This contract governs your pricing with
            UGP during the term of your contract, but the timing of application of
            those prices to your utility bill may be impacted by the timing of your
            utility meter read cycles. The utility will deliver the natural gas you
            purchase from UGP to your premises, read your meter, provide emergency
            services, and issue your bill each month. The utility will charge you
            separately for those services. UGPâ€™s charges for natural gas will appear as
            a separate line item on your bill. Sales tax will appear separately.
        </p>
        <p class="mt10" align="justify">
            For new customers, your contract begins on your effective date as
            established by the utility and continues for the period specified in your
            welcome letter. For existing UGP customers, choosing a new price plan, your
            contract is effective upon the date your price plan change request is
            processed by UGP, and continues for the length of your contract, unless a
            later effective date is determined between you and UGP. Your price plan,
            per unit price, as applicable if you have selected a fixed or variable
            plan, are specified in your welcome letter. UGP offers residential pricing
            for residential customers and commercial pricing for commercial customers.
            UGP may from time to time offer promotional or discounted prices. Sales tax
            and utility charges are not included in the price per Mcf or Ccf, whichever
            is applicable based on your utility. Your plan will incur a monthly service fee of ${{$gasData['msf']}}. If, due
            to a change in market conditions, UGP wishes to lower the price per Ccf or
            Mcf charged to the customer under an existing contract, it may do so
            without consent provided there are no other changes to the terms and
            conditions to the contract. UGP does not charge any late payment fees. UGP
            does not offer budget billing,
        </p>
        <p class="mt10" align="justify">
            With a UGP variable plan, your price per unit of natural gas may change or
            remain the same from month to month based on market conditions. Service
            under a variable plan is on a month-to-month contract basis until cancelled
            by you or UGP. Many factors influence retail natural gas pricing, including
            wholesale gas costs, which are impacted by the weather; general market
            conditions; transportation costs; operating expenses; and other factors.
            UGP sets its prices each month based on the most current information
            available, including, but not limited to, the NYMEX monthly contract price
            for that month. UGP cannot predict the volatility of the market or what its
            customers will pay for gas in the future. Under a variable plan, you may
            switch to another UGP price plan for which you qualify at any time at no
            additional charge. The per-unit price on a variable plan may be higher or
            lower than on a fixed plan.
        </p>
        <p class="mt10" align="justify">
            With a fixed price plan, UGP charges you a fixed price per unit during the
            term of the contract. This contract governs your pricing with UGP during
            the term of your contract, but the timing of application of those prices to
            your utility bill may be impacted by the timing of your utility meter read
            cycles. In addition, because meter read cycles may differ from the start
            and end dates of your fixed price plan contract, you may not receive the
            same number of bills as the number of months in your contract with UGP.
            When you select a fixed price plan, you commit to remain with UGP at the
            same price for the term of your contract. Although UGPâ€™s currently
            available fixed price may change at any time, the price for the term of
            your contract will be UGPâ€™s fixed price in effect at the time you selected
            your fixed plan. The per-unit price on a fixed plan may be higher or lower
            than on a variable plan. If you decide not to renew your contract with UGP,
            whether you select another plan with us, return your natural gas service to
            the utility or choose another natural gas supplier, in order to avoid an
            early termination charge on your current contract, please be sure any
            actions that you take become effective after your current contract expires.

            If you terminate your plan during the initial term of your contract, except
            as specifically set forth in your UGP contract at the time of enrollment,
            UGP will assess you an early termination charge of $150 for residential
            customers or $300 for commercial customers. Your UGP gas charges will be
            billed by the utility, along with the utilityâ€™s charges for its services.
            By agreeing to these terms and conditions of service, you agree to pay UGP
            charges in accordance with the utilityâ€™s payment procedures. If you do not
            pay your bills in accordance with those payment procedures or if you fail
            to comply with any agreed-upon payment arrangement, then the utilityâ€™s
            service may be terminated in accordance with the utilityâ€™s tariffs, and
            this contract may be cancelled. If that occurs, you are required to pay the
            balance owed, including any early termination charges. UGP reserves the
            right to bill you directly for our services, and if that occurs, we may
            complete a credit check and (at our sole discretion) require a security
            deposit. UGP and the utility are responsible for collecting amounts owed on
            their respective bills. Upon 14 daysâ€™ written notice, UGP may cancel this
            contract for nonpayment. In that event, you must pay the entire UGP balance
            due, including any early termination charges.

            will send you a letter confirming your UGP enrollment. You may rescind your
            enrollment without penalty within 7 business days of the postmark date of
            that letter by contacting the utility by phone (Columbia Gas of Ohio:
            1-800-344-4077; Duke Energy: 1-800-544-6900; Dominion East Ohio:
            1-800-362-7557) or in writing. If you cancel a fixed price plan prior to
            the end of the contract term, early termination charges will apply, as
            described above. This contract will terminate automatically if the utility
            does not serve the requested premises, if you move (other than as specified
            below), or if UGP returns you to the utilityâ€™s service.

            You have the right to terminate this contract without penalty if you move
            to a new location outside of your utility service area. You have the right
            to terminate this contract without penalty in the event the customer
            relocates outside the service territory of the incumbent natural gas
            company or within the service territory of an incumbent natural gas company
            that does not permit portability of the contract. You must notify UGP if
            you are moving to a new location outside of your utility service area in
            order to have your early termination charge credited back to you. However,
            UGP can provide service at the new location under a new contract if you
            notify UGP at the time of your move and establish service with the utility
            at the new location with UGP as your service provider. Termination
            typically is effective with the next full utility billing cycle that occurs
            after the utility is notified of the request to terminate service. You are
            responsible for all fees and charges until your service is terminated. If
            you change to another natural gas provider (including the utility), the
            utility may assess a switching fee under its tariff and UGP reserves the
            right to assess a switching fee. If you return to the utility for service,
            then you may be charged a price other than the utilityâ€™s applicable tariff
            rate.
